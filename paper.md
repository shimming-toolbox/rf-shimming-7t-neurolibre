# Summary

Data was collected from five participants between two 7T sites with a custom 8Tx/20Rx parallel transmission (pTx) coil. We explored two RF shimming approaches from an MRI vendor and four from an open-source toolbox, showcasing their ability to enhance transmit field and signal homogeneity along the cervical spinal cord.

The results indicate significant improvements in B1+ efficiency and cerebrospinal fluid / spinal cord signal ratio across various RF shimming conditions compared to the vendor based methods.

The study's findings highlight the potential of RF shimming to advance 7T MRI's clinical utility for central nervous system imaging by enabling more homogenous and efficient spinal cord imaging. Additionally, the research incorporates a reproducible Jupyter Notebook, enhancing the study's transparency and facilitating peer verification. By also making the data openly accessible on OpenNeuro, we ensure that the scientific community can further explore, validate, and build upon our findings, contributing to the collective advancement in high-resolution imaging techniques.


# Statement of need

Advancing the development of 7T MRI for spinal cord imaging is crucial for the enhanced diagnosis and monitoring of various neurodegenerative diseases [@Kearney2015-py] and traumas [@David2019-jy]. However, a significant challenge at this field strength is the transmit field inhomogeneity . Such inhomogeneity is particularly problematic for imaging the small, deep anatomical structures of[@Ibrahim2001-xt;@Collins2005-za;@Roschmann1987-om;@Yang2002-ui] the cervical spinal cord, as it can cause uneven signal intensity and elevate the local specific absorption ratio, compromising image quality. This multi-site study explores several radiofrequency (RF) shimming techniques in the cervical spinal cord at 7T.
